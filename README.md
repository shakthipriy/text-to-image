The official Python client for the Huggingface Hub.

 # Welcome to the huggingface_hub library
The huggingface_hub library allows you to interact with the Hugging Face Hub, a platform democratizing open-source Machine Learning for creators and collaborators. Discover pre-trained models and datasets for your projects or play with the thousands of machine learning apps hosted on the Hub. You can also create and share your own models, datasets and demos with the community. The huggingface_hub library provides a simple way to do all these things with Python.

 # Key features
* Download files from the Hub.
* Upload files to the Hub.
* Manage your repositories.
* Run Inference on deployed models.
* Search for models, datasets and Spaces.
* Share Model Cards to document your models.
* Engage with the community through PRs and comments.


# Installation

Install the huggingface_hub package with pip:

pip install huggingface_hub

In order to keep the package minimal by default, huggingface_hub comes with optional dependencies useful for some use cases. For example, if you want have a complete experience for Inference, run:

pip install huggingface_hub[inference]

# Quick start

Download files

Download a single file

!pip install --upgrade diffusers transformers accelerate


from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]  
    
image.save("astronaut_rides_horse.png")
image

Or an entire repository

from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch
snapshot_download("")

# Integrating to the Hub.
We're partnering with cool open source ML libraries to provide free model hosting and versioning. You can find the existing integrations here.

 # The advantages are:

Free model or dataset hosting for libraries and their users.
Built-in file versioning, even with very large files, thanks to a git-based approach.
Serverless inference API for all models publicly available.
In-browser widgets to play with the uploaded models.
Anyone can upload a new model for your library, they just need to add the corresponding tag for the model to be discoverable.
Fast downloads! We use Cloudfront (a CDN) to geo-replicate downloads so they're blazing fast from anywhere on the globe.
Usage stats and more features to come.
If you would like to integrate your library, feel free to open an issue to begin the discussion. We wrote a step-by-step guide with ❤️ showing how to do this integration.


# Contributions (feature requests, bugs, etc.) are super welcome ❤️
Everyone is welcome to contribute, and we value everybody's contribution. Code is not the only way to help the community. Answering questions, helping others, reaching out and improving the documentations are immensely valuable to the community. We wrote a contribution guide to summarize how to get started to contribute to this repository.
